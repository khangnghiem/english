# 1. Introduction

| Pre-club 2 | Description         |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| Theme      | Whisper!            |
| Activity   | Information Relay   |
| Difficulty | Medium              |
| Objective  | Practice whispering |

It is actually not so hard to understand English whispering
(given you can understand normal English)

# 2. Information is key

- Two teams of participants
- One Representative from each team will be given a piece of information
- All Participants go back to their team and start relaying the information by whispering
- If the final answer is not correct, the team has to start the relay again until they got it right.
- The first team with the accurate response will earn 3 points
  - -1 point for every time the team cheats (e.g. not whispering)
  - the cheater will be removed temporarily from the game
